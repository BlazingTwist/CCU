#		Traits
CCU doesn't add a ton of player-side traits. Most of what goes on in this mod will be concealed from you, in order to create a seamless gameplay experience. However, you do have access to a few new traits. 

##			Language
As of version 1.0.0, The Language system is only partly implemented. These traits will only be important if you know that the campaign or chunk pack(s) you're playing make use of language barriers. Otherwise, the only one worth taking for now is *Speaks High Goryllian*.
