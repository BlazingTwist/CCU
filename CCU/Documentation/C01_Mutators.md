|Mutator											|Effect													|
|:--------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------|
|Homesickness Disabled								|- Followers no longer leave the party at the end of the level.\*
|Homesickness Mandatory								|- Followers *always* leave at the end of the level.\* 

* These will disable Homesickness Killer from being offered on that level's trait choices. But it does not extend to the entire campaign, so if you intend to make use of these you will probably need to notify players before they build their character.
