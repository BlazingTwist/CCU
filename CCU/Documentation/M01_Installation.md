Installation
</h1>
<br><br>

These installation instructions are written for the .zip releases hosted at [this page](https://gamebanana.com/mods/380574).

1. Choose an edition
  - Designer Edition: This edition shows all CCU content on Trait & Mutator lists.
  - Player Edition: This edition hides CCU content so that you can just play it without seeing cluttered trait/mutator menus.

2. Copy the Streets of Rogue folder inside the Edition folder into Steam/Steamapps/Common. The folder structure is prebuilt to place the DLL and Core module into the correct BepInEx folders.

Included Libraries/Plugins:
	RogueLibs
	RogueLibsPatcher
	BTHarmonyUtils
