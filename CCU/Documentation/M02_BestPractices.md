#		Best practices for use
##			Steam Upload
You can upload Custom Characters, Chunk Packs, and Campaigns with CCU content. Players need at least one version of CCU installed for your content to work correctly. 

###				Naming
If you make content with CCU, you are <u>strongly advised</u> to put [Mod], [CCU] or something similar in your steam upload title to catch their attention. You could also put a warning in the upload's image. If they don't have CCU and try to play your content, it will play as a (really confusing) vanilla campaign.

###				Description
In the upload's description, provide a link to the Player Edition and advise them to install it for the full experience.

###				Thumbnail
If you want, you can add a layer to your image thumbnail. This will increase attention to your content and reduce the likelihood of players playing it incorrectly. Below are some images I've made, and you're free to use/edit them as you see fit.
