#		Best practices for use
##			Steam Upload
You can upload Custom Characters, Chunk Packs, and Campaigns with CCU content. Players need at least one version of CCU installed for your content to work correctly. 

If you make content with CCU, you are <u>strongly advised</u> to put [Mod], [CCU] or something similar in your steam upload title to catch their attention. You could also put a warning in the upload's image. If they don't have CCU and try to play your content, it will play as a (really confusing) vanilla campaign.

In the upload's description, provide a link to the Player Edition and advise them to install it for the full experience.
