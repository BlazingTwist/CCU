##			Readables
You can now write and read text with several objects as if they were Signs. This is under the "Investigate" interaction to keep it as broad as possible.

Readable objects: Computer, Gravestone, Shelf, Sign, Podium

Other objects are planned (Table, counter, etc.) but those will require sprite edits.
