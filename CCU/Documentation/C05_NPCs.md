##		Combat Effectiveness

NPCs have fields named `modGunSkill` and `modMeleeSkill`, NPCs with higher skill:
* Are less likely to run when carrying the corresponding weapon type.
* Are more likely to attack with the corresponding weapon type.
* Spend less time idling between attacks.

In vanilla SoR you cannot change these fields, but in CCU you can!  
Custom Characters gain melee- and gunSkill with higher 'Melee' and 'Firearms' attributes, up to an attribute level of **3**.
