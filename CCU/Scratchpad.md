- Works perfectly for a while, but then... it doesn't. Not sure what changes. But I have noticed that loading a chunk through normal means re-sets it, so I think that pathway must be filling out the field that's getting nulled here. It's possible this is a garbage collection thing, too, in the way that I have no idea how that concept works so I couldn't say.

###			C	00 General AI Update error
- Don't test this with Safecrack yet - more vanilla ones will help identify issue

- Hired NPC. Once hired, they couldn't move and framerate skipped
  - The error message goes to A MoveNext that calls BrainUpdate.MyUpdate, so that's our main culprit
  - However, there's a possibility the real issue is in agent.pathfindingAI.UpdateTargetPosition(), and adding these missing declarations in PressedButton_Prefix will resolve a pathfinding issue that was causing the break
    - Nope, that wasn't it. 
  - Occurs for both Bodyguard & targeted skill jobs

uwumacaronitime's idea: Item groups similar to NPC groups

I can see this going two ways: 
- As a trait for NPCs to generate with
- As a designated item in the chunk creator for use in NPC & Object inventories. 

I am leaning towards implementing both of these. But whichever is chosen, make it very clear to avoid confusion.
