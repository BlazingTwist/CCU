Custom Content Utilities
</h1>
<br>

SOR gives you a few options for creating custom content, but it does have some limitations. Here are a few things that are currently impossible with the Vanilla version:
- Aligning Custom NPCs in different chunks
- Variable Custom NPC appearances
- Giving Custom NPCs behaviors like pickpocketing, hiring, selling items, etc.

CCU aims to address these limitations, giving more power to content creators, while keeping the player's experience un-cluttered with designer tools.
#		The Mod Itself
There are two versions of CCU: 
- The Designer Edition is for making or playing enhanced content. 
- The Player edition is for those who only want to play it.
#		Development Priorities
In light of certain questions I've received, I think it is important to be clear about my priorities for this project:
- All content will be retro-compatible. The newest release of CCU will always maintain or improve the functioning of content made with older versions.
- In terms of content, my main goal is to modularize vanilla features to allow designers full control over the basics. Adding new custom content comes later.
- Custom content is curated to allow maximum flexibility and reusability. If a single CCU feature is cool *on its own*, then it probably needs to be broken down into modularized parts. If it can't be broken down and only has one application, it's either crucial or completely unnecessary.
