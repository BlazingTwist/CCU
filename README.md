Custom Content Utilities
</h1>
<br><br>

SOR gives you a LOT of options for creating custom content, but with some limitations. Here are a few things that are currently impossible with the Vanilla version:
- Aligning Custom NPCs in different chunks
- Variable Custom NPC appearances
- Giving Custom NPCs behaviors like pickpocketing, hiring, selling items, etc.
- Campaign level branching and event triggers

CCU aims to address these limitations, giving more power to content creators, while keeping the player's experience un-cluttered with designer tools.

#		The Mod Itself
There are two versions of CCU: 
- The Designer Edition is for making OR playing enhanced content. 
- The Player Edition is for those who only want to play it.
